The working directory when I first ran this code was /home/lecture1. This command needs arguments so it did nothing when I used it without any. It worked properly when I gave it a valid directory, but gave an error when I tried to give it a file. This error makes sense since I'm trying to change the working directory this obviously can't be a file.

I started with my working directory being /home/lecture1. When I used this command without arguments it displayed the contents of the current working directory. However, when I gave it an argument that was a valid directory it displayed that directory's contents instead. Finally, when I used a file as the argument it just displayed the path that I gave it. It makes sense that it gave me an error since once again, this is a command relating to a directory's contents and I gave it a file.

My working directory was the home directory when I ran these commands. When I gave it a valid file as an argument it printed out the contents of the Java file. On the other hand, it gave me an error when I gave it a directory but this makes sense since it's trying to either create or print out the contents of a file. Finally, it had a strange reaction to being given zero arguments where it just let me endlessly press enter and copied any text I tried to put in. This does make sense since this command requires an argument and it was given none.
